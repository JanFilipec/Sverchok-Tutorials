# 2D to ifcOpening

This script generates 3d files from 2d plans with text notes
First it finds relations between rectangular objects representing wall openings and text objects describing the height and elevation of the opening.
Then it extrudes the 2d form and moves it to the correct elevation
The resulting 3d model can be exported as an ifc to do a collision check.
